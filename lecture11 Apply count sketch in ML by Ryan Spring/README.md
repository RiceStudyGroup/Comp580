## 1. What is count sketch?

`wikipedia:`
In computing, the countâ€“min sketch (CM sketch) is a probabilistic data structure that serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data. It uses hash functions to map events to frequencies, but unlike a hash table uses only sub-linear space, at the expense of overcounting some events due to collisions.

are essentially the `same data structure as the counting Bloom filters`
